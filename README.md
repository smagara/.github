## GitHub Repository for this Account

This is a special repository on GitHub that can be used to access shared Templates for common DevOps and project management activity.  This helps to standardize the format and content.
All Repositories on this account will share these templates, unless they have a local override in that Repo's .github folder.

### GitHub Item Templates
When a user creates a new GitHub project Item, a popup will be presented to choose the appropriate template pre-populated with relevant details to fill in for that particular type of issue.
The user is expected to supply relevant information and delete any non-applicable content for clarity.

#### Currently supported:
- Question
- Bug Report
- Feature Request
- Programming Task

### Pull Request Template
- General-purpose Template pre-populated for any Pull Request.
